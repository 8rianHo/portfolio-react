                  A proof of concept for a shared to-do list app idea. The idea
                  was to have a community of friends with shared "bucket lists"
                  they would try to complete together. You could be in a
                  relationship bucket but also multiple friend buckets, and earn
                  points on each activity completed. My first experience with
                  Swift, Xcode, Firebase and Sketch.

                  A challenge I set myself: To upload a game to the App Store. I
                  decided on Rock PaperScissors based on the classic pokemon
                  battle theme. This was coded completely in Swift 3 using
                  Xcode. I learnt about the pros and cons of uploading to the
                  App Store (*cough trademark strikes cough*). I think it peaked
                  at ten downloads by friends and family so it was a win-win all
                  around.

                  Taught myself the basics of Swift and decided to clone the
                  iPhone calculator as a challenge. The logic of a basic
                  calculator was coded in Swift but most of the time was spent
                  on Xcode UI views trying to replicate the default calculator
                  as closely as possible.

                  Teaching assistants can record group progress and students can
